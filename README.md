Dyslexic Reader
===============

This is a quick reimplementation of espeak-gui.
But this time in C and with GTK3.

It is my Dyslexic aid. I'll be honest, it's quick and dirty because it's just for me.

At the moment this is purely for GNU/Linux because that's my home.

Feel free to use it and patches are most welcome.



Install
=======

At the moment it's just from source.

In Debian/Ubuntu/Mint to install required packages do:

    sudo apt-get install gcc make imagemagick libgtk-3-dev libgtksourceview-3.0-dev libespeak-ng-dev

Then to install do:

    sudo make install
