Dyslexic Reader
===============

This is a quick reimplementation of espeak-gui.
But this time in C and with GTK3, and instead of espeak directly it uses
speechd to abstract from exact speech sympathises implementation.

It is my Dyslexic aid.

Feel free to use and patches are most welcome.


Install:

sudo make install
